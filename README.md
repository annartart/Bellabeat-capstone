# Bellabeat-capstone

## Introduction

This is a capstone project that I completed for the Google Data Analytics Certification. I chose a case study with a pre-set scenario and questions. In this project, I am looking for insights for Bellabeat, a company that makes wellness products for women.

## The business task

-   to analyse available data on wellness tracker usage and to identify how the company can grow and become a bigger player at the smart device market

## Key stakeholders

-   The two Bellabeat founders, Urška Sršen and Sando Mur are part of executive team.

-   The marketing team that analyses the data and suggests marketing strategy.

## Guiding questions

**The problem**

Bellabeat wants to become a bigger player at the market of smart devices. They want to understand what they need to change in their marketing strategy. They also want to know what are the usage patterns of the users of bigger smart device companies.

**How can the insights from this analysis drive business decisions?**

The results identify the main points to focus on during marketing company.

## Key indights

- weight trackers are not used consistently, if ever
- users mostly fill in the weight data manually
- activity, sleep, and MET trackers are very popular, everyone in the sample used it
- weight tracker and heart rate tracker are less popular
